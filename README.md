# Video-Compiler-Bot

This bot is mainly focused around memes and a game that is present in it. There are 3 main features of this bot and they are the Spelling Bee Game, the Baka Mitai (Dame Da Ne) deepfake meme generator, and the Youtube Video Compiler. 

The Spelling Bee Game is just as it sounds. When you enter a command, the bot would join the discord voice channel you are currently in and initiate a spelling bee game as shown in the video below 


The Deep Fake Meme Generator uses the First Order Motion Model from https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model with some minor modifications here and there in the code. The Generator essentially takes an image that the user inputs and turns it into a deepfake meme
